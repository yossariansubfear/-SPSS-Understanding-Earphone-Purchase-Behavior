# Understanding-Earphone-Purchase-Behavior

## Summary

1. **Management Objective (M.O.)** : To determine the factors that influence the consumer purchase behaviour for a headphone/earphone.  
   The research group identified 5 research objectives which would exhaustively cover the management objective.  
2. **Primary Data Collection** : An exploratory research was done in the form of 2 focus group discussions and 2 depth interviews from where numerous 
   variables of interest were determined and identified. Certain information gaps were found for which there was need for primary information.  
4. **Filling in info gaps** : The next step involved preparing a questionnaire to find out sufficient data to plug-in these information gaps. The
   questions were framed in nominal scale and Likert scale was used as the chosen attitude scale. The sampling plan was convenience sampling. Subsequently,    the research group went out to collect responses from the general public.  
4. **Data Preprocessing**: Next, the data collected in the previous stage was prepared for analysis with the help of editing, coding and transcribing. 
   Since the questions were in nominal scale, so the appropriate analysis technique followed them.  
5. **Analysis**: Three techniques were used for the process, **Clustering**, **Anova** and **Chi-Squared tests**, and the results and findings of
   the analysis process was correlated with each R.O. and then inferences were drawn, most of which stressed on the fact that most of the variables were      independent in nature and there was less of a dependence relation between them. The report was subsequently compiled along with the applicability and      limitations for future research.
